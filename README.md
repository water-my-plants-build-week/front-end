# Water My Plants

## What is it?

Water My Plants is an application that helps you remember to water your plants
by reminind you via text.

## How do you use it?

You can sign up [here](). The next step is to add some plants, and set when
you'd like to be reminded. Later you'll receive a text message reminding you to
water your plant.

You can update, and delete your plants, and your watering schedules, as well as
change user preferences such as which phone number to text.

## Who are we?

There are two of us working on the Front End team.

## What technologies were used? 

To build the app we used React, Redux, React Router, and Styled Components. 

We also used design tools like Figma to help put together wireframes/prototypes
of our designs.
